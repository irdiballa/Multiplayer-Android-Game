# Multiplayer-Android-Game
This project is a simple multiplayer game. Two player are needed in order to start a challenge. A challenge consist of a group of several games. The one who wins 3 games first is declared the winner of the challenge. In a database I will keep data about the name of the players, their wins, losses and their win percentage. The game will be created using Android Studio and will be tested on my own mobile phone.
